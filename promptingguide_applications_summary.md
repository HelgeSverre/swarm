## 2. Function Calling with LLMs

**Description**: The ability to reliably connect LLMs to external tools to enable effective tool usage and interaction with external APIs.

**Key Use Case**: Creating conversational agents that can convert natural language into structured API calls, enabling interactions with external tools and knowledge bases.

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Define function(s) with name, description, and parameters
2. Pass function definitions to LLM
3. LLM generates JSON with function arguments
4. Call external function with returned arguments
5. Optionally return result to LLM for final response

**Practical Example**: User asks "What is the weather like in London?" - the system defines a `get_current_weather` function, extracts location and units, calls weather API, and generates a natural language response.

**Important Considerations**:
- Works best with models fine-tuned for function calling
- Requires clear, well-defined function specifications
- Enables complex interactions between LLMs and external systems
- Supports use cases like conversational agents, data extraction, and API integration

4. Create generative model instance
5. Query cached content

**Practical Example**: Analyzing ML paper summaries, allowing queries like "List papers mentioning Mamba" without re-uploading the entire document each time.

**Important Considerations**:
- Reduces redundant token usage

## 4. Generating Data with LLMs

**Description**: Using LLMs to generate coherent, structured data samples that can be used for various experimental and evaluation purposes.

**Key Use Case**: Creating synthetic datasets, such as sentiment analysis examples, for testing and training machine learning models.

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Craft a specific prompt defining the data generation requirements
2. Specify desired output format
3. Request a specific number and type of examples
4. Leverage the LLM's ability to generate contextually relevant content

**Practical Example**: Generating 10 sentiment analysis examples (8 positive, 2 negative) with a question and corresponding sentiment label.

**Important Considerations**:
- Use clear, structured prompts
- Specify desired output format
- Define precise requirements (number, type of examples)
- Verify generated data's quality and relevance
- Experiment with different prompt strategies

## 5. PROMPTGATOR (Synthetic Dataset Generation for RAG)

**Description**: A method for generating synthetic training data using large language models to improve retrieval performance, especially in specialized or low-resource domains.

**Key Use Case**: Creating high-quality training datasets for retrieval models when manual labeled data is scarce, such as developing domain-specific chatbots (e.g., Czech legal assistance, tax advisory).

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Prepare a task-specific prompt with 4-8 manually labeled examples
2. Use an LLM (like ChatGPT/GPT-4) to generate queries for documents
3. Generate multiple query variations for each document
4. Use synthetic dataset to fine-tune retrieval model

**Practical Example**: For a legal domain, create a prompt that instructs the LLM to "Identify a counter-argument" for legal passages, generating relevant search queries.

**Important Considerations**:
- Choose representative, high-quality manual examples
- Ensure examples are correctly formatted
- Specify desired query characteristics (length, tone)
- Can be cost-effective: generating 50,000 synthetic data points might cost around $55
- Synthetic data can potentially match performance of manually labeled datasets

## 6. Diverse Synthetic Dataset Generation for Textbooks

**Description**: A method for generating diverse, high-quality synthetic training data using large language models by introducing randomness and specific constraints in prompting.

**Key Use Case**: Creating training datasets for machine learning models, particularly in scenarios with limited access to real-world data, such as children's story generation or coding education.

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Identify variable parameters in dataset generation
2. Compile collections of entities to randomize (e.g., vocabulary words, story features)
3. Generate content by randomly selecting and inserting these entities
4. Use higher temperature settings for increased diversity
5. Potentially use hierarchical/iterative generation techniques

**Practical Example**: Generating children's stories by randomly selecting a verb ("decorate"), noun ("thunder"), adjective ("ancient"), and story features (dialogue, bad ending).

**Important Considerations**:
- Randomization helps prevent dataset repetitiveness
- Target specific audience complexity levels
- Use high-quality LLMs for generation
- Validate synthetic data's effectiveness through testing
- Consider computational costs of large-scale generation

## 7. Code Generation with LLMs

**Description**: Various techniques for using LLMs to generate, complete, and transform code across different programming tasks.

**Key Use Cases**:
- Basic code generation from natural language
- Comments-to-code conversion
- Function/line completion
- Database query generation

**Implementation Approaches**:

### Basic Code Generation
- Directly instruct LLMs to write code snippets
- Example: Writing a program that asks for a user's name and says "Hello"

### Comments-to-Code Conversion
- Transform natural language comments into functional code
- Example: Converting a comment list about movie ratings into a Python script

### Function/Line Completion
- Automatically complete partial code or suggest next lines
- Example: Completing a function to multiply numbers and add 75

### Query Generation
- Create database queries based on specified requirements
- Example: Generating MySQL queries to fetch specific data

**Important Considerations**:
- Always review generated code
- Check for missing import statements
- Test generated code thoroughly
- Use clear, specific instructions
- LLMs can generate functional code but may miss small details

## 8. Prompt Engineering for Job Classification

**Description**: A systematic approach to improving large language model performance on classifying whether job postings are suitable for recent graduates.

**Key Use Case**: Automated job posting classification for entry-level/graduate positions using GPT-3.5-turbo.

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Start with baseline prompt
2. Incrementally modify prompt techniques:
   - Add role instructions
   - Use system and user messages
   - Mock conversational context
   - Reiterate key instructions
   - Provide additional context
   - Give model a name
   - Offer positive reinforcement

**Practical Example**: Transforming a basic job classification prompt from 65.6 F1 score to 91.7 F1 score through strategic prompt modifications.

**Important Considerations**:
- Few-shot Chain of Thought performed worse than zero-shot
- Precise instructions dramatically improve performance
- Small prompt modifications can have significant impact
- Template strictness doesn't always improve accuracy
- Conversational elements (naming, positive feedback) can subtly enhance model performance
- "Properly giving instructions and repeating the key points appears to be the biggest performance driver."

**Template Format**:
```
function_name: [function_name]
input: ["text"]
rule: [specific processing instructions]
```

**Practical Example**: An English study assistant with three functions:
- `trans_word`: Translates text to English
