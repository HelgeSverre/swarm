# Gemini Agent Improvement Plan

This document outlines a strategic roadmap for enhancing the "Swarm" AI coding agent's capabilities, based on an analysis of provided documentation and web research into state-of-the-art agentic AI patterns.

## 1. Analysis and Key Insights

A review of `docs/REFERENCES.md` and the `docs/system_prompts_leaks/` directory revealed several core themes and powerful techniques used by advanced AI systems like Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's GPT series.

*   **Advanced Agentic Patterns**: The most capable agents are moving beyond simple "plan-and-execute" workflows to more dynamic models like **ReAct (Reason-Act)**, which allows for real-time adaptation and error correction.
*   **Structured Reasoning**: High-end models are often guided to produce structured output (JSON/XML) for their internal thoughts and plans (e.g., Claude's `<commit_analysis>` blocks). This improves reliability and makes the agent's process more transparent and debuggable.
*   **Hierarchical Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks are broken down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This is the foundation for multi-agent systems where specialized agents can tackle different parts of a problem.
*   **Multi-Layered Memory**: Effective agents require more than just short-term conversational history. The `CLAUDE.md` file concept provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for persistent, project-specific memory.
*   **Self-Correction and Reflection**: The ability for an agent to critique its own work, analyze failures, and refine its plan is a key driver of quality and robustness.

## 2. Proposed Implementation Strategies

Based on these insights, here are three key strategies to improve Swarm, categorized by complexity.

### Strategy 1: ReAct (Reason-Act) Loop

*   **Insight**: Transition from a rigid plan-and-execute model to a dynamic loop where the agent continuously reasons, acts, and observes the outcome.
*   **Value for Swarm**: This will allow the agent to handle unexpected errors (e.g., compiler failures, failed tests) by re-evaluating its plan based on the new information, rather than failing completely.
*   **Implementation**:
    1.  Merge the `planTask()` and `executeTask()` methods into a single, iterative `processTask()` loop.
    2.  In each loop, the agent first generates a "Thought" about the current state and the next best action.
    3.  It then executes an "Action" (a tool call).
    4.  The result of the action becomes the "Observation" that informs the next thought, continuing until the task is complete.

### Strategy 2: Hierarchical Task Decomposition & Multi-Agent Collaboration

*   **Insight**: Decompose large, complex user requests into a dependency graph of smaller sub-tasks that can be handled by specialized agents.
*   **Value for Swarm**: This enables greater modularity and expertise. A `CodeWriterAgent` can focus on writing code, while a `TestingAgent` can focus on verification, and a `CodeReviewerAgent` can ensure quality and adherence to conventions.
*   **Implementation**:
    1.  Define agent roles with specific system prompts and toolsets.
    2.  Enhance the `TaskManager` to support task dependencies, creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks.
    3.  An `OrchestratorAgent` would be responsible for creating this task graph and dispatching tasks to the appropriate specialist agents.

### Strategy 3: Self-Correction and Reflection

*   **Insight**: Formalize a process for the agent to learn from its mistakes and review its own work.
*   **Value for Swarm**: This leads to higher-quality code and more robust error handling. The agent can autonomously fix its own bugs.
*   **Implementation**:
    1.  Create a `reflectOnError()` prompt that asks the LLM to diagnose the cause of a failed tool or command and propose a fix.
    2.  Integrate this into the core loop by catching exceptions and failed tool executions.
    3.  Add a final "Self-Review" step to any code-generation task, where the agent critiques its own code before finishing.

## 3. Recommended Roadmap: Crawl, Walk, Run

1.  **Crawl (Immediate Priority):** Implement a simple, project-specific memory using a `.swarm.md` file. This is a high-impact, low-complexity feature that provides immediate value by giving the agent context about the specific project it's working on.
2.  **Walk (Next Major Feature):** Re-architect the core agent logic to use a **ReAct loop**. This is the most significant and impactful change to improve the agent's general problem-solving ability.
3.  **Run (Future Vision):** Evolve the ReAct-based agent into a full **Multi-Agent System** that utilizes hierarchical task decomposition and self-correction. This represents a state-of-the-art architecture for a powerful and autonomous coding assistant.
