# Code Coverage Setup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Composer Scripts (Already Updated)
The `composer.json` already has the basic coverage script:
```json
"coverage": "herd coverage vendor/bin/pest --coverage"
```

### 2. ✅ Updated Testing Documentation
Enhanced `docs/TESTING.md` with:
- Laravel Herd coverage instructions
- Alternative methods for non-Herd users
- Troubleshooting for Xdebug warnings
- Coverage badge setup instructions

### 3. ✅ Verified .gitignore
Confirmed that `coverage/` directory is already ignored

### 4. ✅ Tested Coverage Generation
- HTML reports are generated in `coverage/html/`
- Text reports are generated in `coverage/coverage.txt`
- Current overall coverage: 49.2%
- WebFetch tool coverage: 93%

## Quick Usage Guide

### Running Coverage with Herd

```bash
# Basic coverage report
composer coverage

# HTML coverage report
herd coverage ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage --coverage-html=coverage/html

# With minimum threshold
herd coverage ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage --min=80

# Specific test file
herd coverage ./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/Tools/WebFetchTest.php --coverage
```

### Viewing Coverage Reports

1. **Terminal Output**: Shows inline after running tests
2. **HTML Report**: Open `coverage/html/index.html` in your browser
3. **Text Report**: View `coverage/coverage.txt` for detailed line-by-line coverage

## Coverage Goals

Based on the current state:
- Overall project coverage: 49.2%
- Well-tested components:
  - WebFetch: 93%
  - PromptTemplates: 100%
  - Task/TaskManager: 100%
  - Terminal/ReadFile/WriteFile: 100%
- Areas needing coverage:
  - CodingAgent: 0% (main business logic)
  - CLI components: 0%
  - Enums: 0% (low priority)

## Next Steps

1. **Increase Coverage**: Focus on CodingAgent and CLI components
2. **Set Coverage Goals**: Consider enforcing minimum 80% for new code
3. **CI Integration**: Add coverage checks to GitHub Actions
4. **Coverage Badges**: Add to README once CI is set up
