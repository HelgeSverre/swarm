# SwarmCLI Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored SwarmCLI to improve testability by implementing dependency injection and moving task history management to the TaskManager.

## Changes Made

### 1. SwarmCLI Constructor Refactoring
- Modified constructor to accept dependencies: `CodingAgent`, `UI`, and `LoggerInterface`
- Defaults: UI creates new instance if not provided, Logger defaults to NullLogger
- This allows for easier testing by injecting mock dependencies

### 2. Static Factory Method
- Added `SwarmCLI::createFromEnvironment()` static method
- Handles all environment configuration and dependency creation
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing usage

### 3. Task History Management
- Moved task history functionality from SwarmCLI to TaskManager
- Added to TaskManager:
  - `$taskHistory` array property with 1000 task limit
  - `addToHistory()` method with duplicate prevention
  - `getTaskHistory()` and `setTaskHistory()` methods
  - `clearCompletedTasks()` method to manage task lifecycle
  - `getTasksAsArrays()` for backward compatibility
- Updated SwarmCLI to use TaskManager's history functionality

### 4. CodingAgent Enhancement
- Added `getTaskManager()` method to expose TaskManager instance
- Allows SwarmCLI to access task history functionality

### 5. Entry Point Update
- Updated `cli.php` to use `SwarmCLI::createFromEnvironment()`
- No changes needed to `bin/swarm` script

### 6. Test Coverage
- Created `TaskManagerHistoryTest.php` for task history functionality
- Created `SwarmCLIConstructorTest.php` for factory method testing
- Updated `SwarmCLITaskHistoryTest.php` to reflect new architecture
- All tests passing (11 tests, 44 assertions)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Testability**: Dependencies can now be injected, making unit testing easier
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Task history management is now in TaskManager where it belongs
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work via the factory method
4. **Type Safety**: Maintained type hints and proper return types throughout
5. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

## Files Modified

- `/src/CLI/SwarmCLI.php` - Constructor and factory method
- `/src/Task/TaskManager.php` - Task history functionality
- `/src/Agent/CodingAgent.php` - Added getTaskManager method
- `/cli.php` - Updated to use factory method
- `/tests/Unit/Task/TaskManagerHistoryTest.php` - New test file
- `/tests/Unit/CLI/SwarmCLIConstructorTest.php` - New test file
- `/tests/Unit/CLI/SwarmCLITaskHistoryTest.php` - Updated tests

## Next Steps

If further improvements are desired:
1. Consider adding interfaces for better abstraction
2. Implement a proper DI container for complex dependency graphs
3. Add more granular configuration options
4. Consider separating state persistence into its own service
